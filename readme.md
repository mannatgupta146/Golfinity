# Golfinity 🌟

**Golfinity** is a stylish and interactive golf-themed landing page, inspired by [Sidcup Family Golf](https://sidcupfamilygolf.com/). Designed with modern web technologies, it brings together custom cursor effects, fluid animations, and a sleek layout to create an immersive user experience.


## ✨ What I Learned

- How to integrate **SheryJS** for animated cursors and magnetic hover effects
- Using **GSAP** with **ScrollTrigger** for scroll-based transitions and animations
- Responsive layout techniques for complex sections
- Styling with custom fonts, gradients, and layered visuals
- Video backgrounds, animated cards, and modern UI design principles

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I built **Golfinity** as a front-end development learning project to practice:

- Real-world layout structuring
- Modern design principles (glassmorphism, layered layouts, gradients)
- Scroll-triggered animations
- Cursor interactivity
- Creating responsive, immersive landing pages

The goal was to **recreate a professional-grade UI** and understand how to turn design inspiration into a working web product.
